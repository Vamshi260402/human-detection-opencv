# Human Detection using OpenCV

This project uses OpenCV's HOG + SVM-based human detection model to detect people in a video.

## How It Works

- Loads a video using OpenCV
- Applies HOG-based human detection on each frame
- Draws bounding boxes around detected humans

## How to Run

### 1. Install OpenCV
